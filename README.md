# zwavejs2mqtt-socat
Docker config for creating a docker image with zwavejs2mqtt and socat  

Based on https://github.com/mc303/zigbee2mqtt-socat

Not yet functional, description will be updated once it's up and running.

Mainly created for my own needs, but I can imagine there are more people who could use this in their setup.
